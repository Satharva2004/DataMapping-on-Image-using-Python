# üßæ Receipt Generator for ICETI4T 2025 using Streamlit + FPDF
--
This project is built to generate official **receipts for ICETI4T 2025** based on participant data uploaded via an Excel sheet. It uses a professional template image and a clean font to produce PDF files for each entry ‚Äî downloadable individually or in bulk.

While this tool is currently tailored for generating **receipts**, you can easily repurpose it for:
- Participation **certificates**
- **Invoices**
- **Event passes**
- Or **any document** where dynamic data needs to be placed on a pre-designed template.

> ‚öôÔ∏è **Note:** The text placement (X, Y coordinates) is fixed inside the code under the `COORDINATES` dictionary. You are free to adjust the positions and template to suit your layout.

- Preview and filter uploaded data.
- Generate single or bulk PDFs.

## üóÇ Required Files

Make sure you have the following in the root directory:

- **Template Image**: `Black and White Minimalist Business Invoice.png`  
  Used as the background for each receipt (can be replaced with any design).

- **Font File**: `Ubuntu-Medium.ttf`  
  Used to render the text professionally onto the PDF.

## üõ† COORDINATE SETTINGS

COORDINATES = {
    "InvoiceID": (135, 57),
    "Date": (135, 75),
    "ClientName": (10, 75),
    "Amount": (10, 187),
    "Description": (10, 135),
}
